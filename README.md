# Clip
Effortlessly copy & paste between devices.

### How it works
1. Open up [the site](https://clip.glitch.je) on two devices (or two tabs if you're testing!). 
2. On one page, click **Create Session**
3. On another page, enter the **Session ID** and click **Join**
4. Type in the box, hit enter, and watch it appear on the other page!

> [!NOTE]
> You can delete invidual items or delete the entire session itself. Please note that clicking Change session will not delete the session, it will remove you from it.

> [!NOTE]
> Sessions expire automatically after 1 hour of inactivity
